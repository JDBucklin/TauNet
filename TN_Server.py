#TN_Server.py
#
#This file contains a server implementation for a TauNet node.
#
#It contains a TauNetServer class that enables a user to recieve messages from other
#TauNet nodes within their network. The ability to send messages is implemented
#separately in TN_Client.py.
#
#For more information about TauNet read the included readme.txt that should be
#included with this package.
#
#Files necessary for the operation of this software:
#data.txt - contains info about the username associated with this node and port addresses
#user_table.txt - contains the user table for the TauNet network.
#
#If either of these files is not present please read readme.txt for information about how to get them.
#
#A note about max message length. It is currently specified in TauNet Protocol v0.2 that the max # of
#bytes per message is 1024. The maximum # of bytes in the header section is:
#Header	Space	Payload	Line Ending
#8	1	3	2
#5	1	30	2
#3	1	30	2
#0	1	0	2 <----space in between header and message and trailing newline/return of message
#		Total	91
#which leaves 1024 - 89 = 933 characters that can be used in the actual message.
#these numbers are stored in data.txt.
